1) What did you like about this project?

Ans: I like that what we learned in Javascript to apply coding for a simple game. 

2) What did you struggle with in this project?

Ans: Initially, I struggled with displaying the movement of * character and how to get the game to recognize 
when the char * fell into the hole.  But in the end, I managed to get them to work as expected.

3) What would make your experience with this assessment better?

Ans: Actually I felt good that I managed to get the game to work in the end. So it was overall a good experience at the
end of it.
